This is one of my course assignment where the data was extracted from the dataset Uber Daily Travel Times 18 Cities 2016-2020 on Kaggle, and extracted from a London-based weather station dataset on Meteostat.<br />
The dataset contains the mean travel time (in seconds) of Uber rides from the center-most area in London to all other areas, together with information on weather conditions
(temperature, precipitation and wind speeds) from a weather station in London. <br />
Time series analysis including ARIMA model, HW model and ANN model was performed to predict the mean travel time.
